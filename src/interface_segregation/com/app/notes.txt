Interface segregation
Segregation means keeping things separated

Create different interfaces for logically separate operations.
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

IMP: Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.


flyable
walkable

Human -  implements walkable
Bird  - implements flyable, walkable
